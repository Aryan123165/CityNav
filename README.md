## 🚀 The Problem
Commuters often face uncertainty regarding bus timings and over-crowded vehicles. Traditional systems lack:
- Real-time location accuracy.
- Information on seat availability/crowd levels.
- Contactless, quick-verification ticketing.

## ✨ Our Solution
CityNav bridges the gap between public transport and technology with:
1. **Live Bus Tracking:** Real-time movement of fleet on an interactive map.
2. **Crowd Analytics:** Live crowd density indicators (Green/Red) to help passengers choose less crowded buses.
3. **Smart Routing:** Dynamic filtering of buses based on selected routes (e.g., RTU Campus to Railway Station).
4. **Digital Ticketing & QR Verification:** - **Passenger:** Instant ticket generation with unique IDs and QR codes.
   - **Conductor:** A dedicated portal to verify tickets and prevent double-usage.
